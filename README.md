# Light-Hash-Algorithm-DES-S-box

## Directories:

### Doc
1. **light_hash_algorithm-DES-S-box**: contains the requirements of the project.

### Db
This folder contains the files used to implement the requirements:
1. **Sbox**: is the implementation of the required Sbox.
2. **Round**: implementation of a single round of the light hash algorithm.
3. **HashIteration**: implementation of the hash function that exploits Round.
4. **lightHashDES**: this module performs a light hash function based on DES s-box.

### Model
This folder contains the model of the circuit for the implementation of the light hash algorithm.
