"# Light-Hash-Algorithm-DES-S-box" 

Directories:

- Doc: contains the requirements of the project.

- Db: contains the files used to implement the requirements:
      - Sbox: is the implementation of the required Sbox.
      - Round: implementation of a single round of the light hash algorithm.
      - HashIteration: implementation of the hash function that exploits Round.
      - lightHashDES: this module performs a light hash function based on DES s-box.
